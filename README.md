# AlexNet
## Directory Structure
1. Golden C++
2. HLS
3. Python

## Python
* All data file (output, weights and bias) for each layer can be found in the **data_txt** directory.
* **epochs_50.ipynb** is the python code for our AlexNet architecture using tensorflow and keras.
* **Data_extract.ipynb** is the python code for extracting and store each layer output, weights and bias into txt files.
* **epochs_50.h5** is our AlexNet model, which can directly be used for loading our implemented model.
